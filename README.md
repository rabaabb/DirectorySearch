# DirectorySearch
Whilst working on a Product Management internship, one of our aims was to market our product to potential users, which were students in the area. Since we did not have access to directories (since they were private information), our team had to come up with our own way to gather addresses of all students in the area. Using the Melissa Search Database (https://www.melissa.com/v2/lookups/batchpersonatorsearch/), we created an automated process of gathering such data.

You run the excel file(Yearbook data) through the Melissa Process first â€“ gives you a csv file of all the addresses (from last names).
Then you run that csv file through the bright fox address code to get a csv file of send able addresses.
